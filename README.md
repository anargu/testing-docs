# Testing-docs

I share with you all I know about software testing so far.
I research different sources to complement the information with concepts.

# How to see the content?

The content was written in markdown files (all *.md files you can find in this
repo).

The content is a set of slides produced/generated with mdslides.

[Mdslides](https://gitlab.com/da_doomer/markdown-slides) is a tool that generates presentations (html files) from .md files.

It can be watched by serving the html files and visiting them via browser
(visiting to localhost).

There are several ways to serve the html files. One way is using the
live-server npm package. Just intall the npm package globally. Then, on
terminal go to the directory where there is the index.html and run "live-server"

# Future changes

I'll update with new content from time to time.
