# Testing-docs

I share with you all I know about software testing.
I research different sources to complement the information with concepts.

# How to see the content?

The content was written in markdown files (all *.md files you can find in this
repo).

The content is a set of slides produced/generated with mdslides.

[Mdslides](https://gitlab.com/da_doomer/markdown-slides) is a tool that generates presentations (html files) from .md files.

It can be watched by serving the html files and visiting them via browser.

# Future changes

I'll update with new content from time to time.
